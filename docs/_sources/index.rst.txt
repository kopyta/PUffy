Welcome to PUffy's Documentation!🐡
===========================================

PUffy is a Python library designed for creating the best possible models given a dataset with positive-unlabeled data. It implements a two-step classification approach. The package is also suitable for considerations on PU classification with a fully labeled dataset, as the package presents labeling methods to artificially mimic labeling mechanisms resulting in positive-unlabeled data. Puffy consists of four modules: `labelling_methods`, `rn_methods`, `training`, and `pu_pipeline`.

So far, it offers:

- 4 labeling methods:
   + one method assuming SCAR scenario,
   + three methods being variants of SAR setting,
- 3 techniques for identifying reliable-negative samples from the unlabeled data:
   + a technique based on KMeans,
   + a technique based on KNN,
   + a technique based on Spy analysis,
- an iterative classification model for identifying reliable negatives, using Logistic Regression classification,
- visualizations of the model performance,
- a naive classification method for comparison,
- a pipeline, with which presented experiments were conducted.

As of today, the package is meant for binary classification problems.
